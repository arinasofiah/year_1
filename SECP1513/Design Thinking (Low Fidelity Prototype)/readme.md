SUMMARY and REFLECTION
====================================================================================================================================
* The design thinking project definitely helps me in challenging myself and team members in terms of my creativity and solving problem skills that will certainly be
 helpful in the future. With the Stain Slayer, I also managed to learn the impact of artificial intelligence and how much the users and I depend on the technology due to its ease of use when most of the responses agreed on implementing chatbots to help the users. 
* Next, with my team members I managed to practise my teamwork skills and I am very thankful to meet and join hands with such amazing and diverse team members that I personally think would be quite impactful especially when meeting with new colleagues during my working days.
* In my opinion, I would engage myself with
 most of the activities and programs that are
 done by the faculty and college to gain more
 insights and knowledge with what is
 currently trending in the world of evolving
 technology these days, for example the
 blockchain tech talk that was held by
 PESAKA themselves.
* Lastly, I would also
 partake in becoming crew members of
 certain programs that will help in my
 communicating skills and also team building
 that will be a crucial part in the industry where meeting with clients and also
 colleagues will become a new norm in the
 future. Therefore, I would join more
 programs and activities to gain more
 insightful skills.
