SUMMARY and REFLECTION
====================================================================================================================================
 The design thinking project definitely helps me in challenging myself and team members in terms of my creativity and solving problem skills that will certainly be
 helpful in the future. With the Stain Slayer, I also managed to learn the impact of artificial
 intelligence and how much the users and I
 depend on the technology due to its ease of
 use when most of the responses agreed on
 implementing chatbots to help the users.
 Next, with my team members I managed to
 practise my teamwork skills and I am very
 thankful to meet and join hands with such
 amazing and diverse team members that I
 personally think would be quite impactful
 especially
 when meeting with new
 colleagues during my working days.
